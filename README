I am writing this web version an exercise in using JavaScript and Dojo, Dijits and unit testing.

To install:
Download tetravex.html and put it in a directory with 
"dojo-release-1.6.0" which you can get from the Dojo site.
I run it on a local webserver, but I guess it should work
from the file system.

Phill.
